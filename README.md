## Hi, I'm James üë®üèº‚Äçüíª 

### I'm a Full Stack Developer who's passionate about Javascript and all related technologies, especially React. ###

I strongly believe that in the digital age, being able to code is one of the best ways to express yourself creatively. I love taking an idea or concept and turning it into an amazing user experience.

**The following quote from Liam Neeson encapsulates my approach to learning new technologies**...  
*"I don't know who you are, and I don't know what you do. I don‚Äôt have money, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills that I'm always looking to expand by learning new technologies. If you provide me with a direct link to your documentation that'll be the end of it. But if you don't, I will google, and I will find them, and then I will learn it anyway."*


**Looking to collaborate** on anything exciting! Whether you're experimenting with new solutions or improving existing solutions I'd be happy to get involved. There's nothing I'd rather be doing than coming up with creative solutions to problems I'm passionate about.

**looking for active discussion**. I think it's always important to continue to grow and other people provide a wealth of knowledge and experience that is often underestimated. 

**Ask me about** anything to do with Javascript and related technologies.

**Connect with me** on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmpoulton33/) to see what I'm getting up to. I love to hear about interesting ideas and discuss past experiences. 

### So it looks like all you do is code? Isn't there anything you like to do in your free time?  
Unfortunately for my neighbours, I love to play the guitar and sing out of tune. üé∏     

I love sports and fitness, and I'm especially passionate about basketball.  üèÄ üèã     

 **Finally...**     
I often choose to work on projects which cater to a niche group of users. I find that the tech industry is great at appealing to the largest possible audience, but there's something to be said for developing a more targeted user experience that tackles a specific issue.  **Nothing makes me happier than knowing that something I've built is helping make someone else's day easier.**
